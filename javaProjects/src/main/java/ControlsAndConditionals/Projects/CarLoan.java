/**
 * A Simple Car Loan Payment Calculator
 * Letâ€™s combine a few of the concepts that you have learned so far: conditionals, Boolean expressions, and arithmethic expressions.
 *
 * In this project, you will write a program that will calculate the monthly car payment a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan. The program will include the following:
 *
 * Car loan amount
 * Interest rate of the loan
 * Length of the loan (in years)
 * Down payment
 * */
